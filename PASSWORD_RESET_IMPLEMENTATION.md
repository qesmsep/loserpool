## Setup Instructions

### 1. Environment Variables

Add these to your `.env.local` file:

```bash
# Site Configuration (NEW)
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://loserpool.app

# Resend Configuration (NEW)
RESEND_API_KEY=your_resend_api_key_here
```

### 2. Get Resend API Key

1. Go to [https://resend.com](https://resend.com)
2. Create a free account
3. Get your API key from the dashboard
4. Add it to your environment variables

### 3. Vercel Deployment

Add the same environment variables to your Vercel project:
- Go to your Vercel dashboard
- Navigate to your project settings
- Add the environment variables

## Testing the System

### 1. Test the Setup

Visit: `https://your-domain.com/api/auth/test-password-reset`

You should see:
```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "message": "Password reset system is ready",
  "supabase": "connected",
  "environment": {
    "siteUrl": "https://loserpool.vercel.app",
    "hasResendKey": true,
    "hasServiceRoleKey": true
  }
}
```

### 2. Test the Full Flow

1. Go to `/login`
2. Click "Forgot your password?"
3. Enter a valid email address
4. Check your email for the reset link
5. Click the link and set a new password
6. Verify you can sign in with the new password

## How It Works

### 1. Request Reset
- User enters email on `/reset-password`
- API validates email and generates secure reset link
- Resend sends branded email with reset link

### 2. Reset Password
- User clicks link in email
- System validates the reset token
- User sets new password with validation
- System updates password and signs out user
- User is redirected to login

### 3. Security Features
- Secure tokens with 1-hour expiration
- Password strength validation
- No information disclosure about user existence
- Automatic sign-out after password change

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **"Supabase connection failed"**
   - Check your `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
   - Verify Supabase project is active

2. **"Failed to send email"**
   - Check your `RESEND_API_KEY`
   - Verify Resend account is active
   - Check email domain verification

3. **"Invalid reset link"**
   - Links expire after 1 hour
   - User should request a new link

4. **Environment variables not working**
   - Restart your development server
   - Check Vercel environment variables
   - Verify variable names are correct

## Email Template Customization

The email template is in `src/lib/resend.ts`. You can customize:
- Colors and branding
- Email content and messaging
- Button styling
- Footer information

## Security Notes

- Reset links are single-use and time-limited
- Passwords are validated for strength
- No user information is disclosed
- All operations are logged for security

## Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check the test endpoint first
2. Verify all environment variables are set
3. Check browser console for errors
4. Review server logs for API errors
