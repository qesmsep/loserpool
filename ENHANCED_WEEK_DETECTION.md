# 🏈 Enhanced Week Detection System

## 🎯 **Overview**

The automated matchup update system now includes sophisticated week detection logic that handles special cases where NFL weeks might start on different days, not just Thursday Night Football.

## 🔧 **Key Features**

### **1. Smart Week Start Detection**
- **Thursday Night Football**: Standard week starts on Thursday
- **Special Cases**: Handles weeks that start on Friday, Saturday, or other days
- **Automatic Detection**: Determines week start based on actual game schedules
- **Fallback Logic**: Uses date-based calculation when game data isn't available

### **2. Preseason Week Display**
- **Correct Calculation**: Shows "Preseason Week X" during preseason period
- **Automatic Transition**: Seamlessly switches to "Week X" for regular season
- **Timezone Aware**: Handles timezone differences correctly

### **3. Game Schedule Analysis**
- **First Game Detection**: Identifies the first game of each week
- **Week Boundaries**: Determines week boundaries based on actual game dates
- **Special Game Handling**: Recognizes Thursday Night Football and special games

## 📅 **Week Detection Logic**

### **Preseason Period (August 7 - September 3, 2025)**
```typescript
// Preseason Week 1: Aug 7-13
// Preseason Week 2: Aug 14-20  
// Preseason Week 3: Aug 21-27
// Preseason Week 4: Aug 28-Sep 3
```

### **Regular Season Week Detection**
```typescript
// Standard Week: Thursday -> Sunday
// Special Week: Friday -> Sunday (or other variations)
// Automatic detection based on first game of the week
```

## 🛠 **Technical Implementation**

### **Core Functions**

#### **`getWeekStartDate(gameDate)`**
Determines the start of a week based on a game date:
- If game is Thursday or earlier → That's the week start
- If game is Friday → Previous Thursday is week start
- If game is Saturday → Previous Thursday is week start  
- If game is Monday → Previous Thursday is week start

#### **`getCurrentWeekFromGames(gameDates)`**
Calculates current week by analyzing actual game schedules:
- Sorts all game dates chronologically
- Groups games by week boundaries
- Determines current week based on today's date

#### **`isFirstGameOfWeek(gameDate, allGameDates)`**
Identifies if a specific game is the first game of its week:
- Compares game date with all other games
- Checks week boundaries
- Returns true if it's the earliest game in the week

### **Utility Functions**

#### **Day Detection**
```typescript
isThursday(date)     // Thursday Night Football
isFriday(date)       // Special Friday games
isSaturday(date)     // Special Saturday games
isSunday(date)       // Regular Sunday games
isMonday(date)       // Monday Night Football
```

#### **Game Classification**
```typescript
isThursdayNightFootball(gameDate)  // TNF games (Thursday 7PM+)
isSpecialGame(gameDate)            // Non-Sunday games
```

#### **Date Formatting**
```typescript
formatGameDateWithDay(gameDate)    // "Thu Aug 15, 7:00 PM"
getDayName(date)                   // "Thursday"
getDayNameShort(date)              // "Thu"
```

## 🔄 **Week Detection Flow**

### **1. Database-First Approach**
```typescript
// Try to get week from actual game schedules
const gameDates = await getAllGameDates()
const currentWeek = getCurrentWeekFromGames(gameDates)
```

### **2. Fallback to Date-Based**
```typescript
// If no game data available, use date calculation
const currentWeek = getCurrentWeekNumber()
```

### **3. Preseason Handling**
```typescript
// Always use date-based for preseason
if (now < regularSeasonStart) {
  return calculatePreseasonWeek()
}
```

## 📊 **Special Cases Handled**
